# Pentaku JS
This is a small game I made to learn some basic javascript and HTML canvas. I intentionally chose to create it using only vanilla javascript in order to master the fundamentals. The name Pentaku came from merging the names of two of the games you can play with this app, [Pentago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago) and [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku).

### [Demo here](http://pentaku.herokuapp.com)

#### The basics:
1. Place player piece on empty space of board
2. (Optional, if rotation enabled) Choose a quadrant and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise or couterclockwise
3. Win by getting enough of your player pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line  

The app includes a GUI that allows the user edit parameters of the game:

| board attribute  | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| rotate radius  | if zero, no rotation is used in the game. Otherwise, this determines the size of the rotation grids |
| columns  | number of columns and rows (allows only values compatible with the rotate radius parameter)  |
| winning length  | number of player pieces in a row required to win the game  |
| players  | number of players  |
| player name, type, color  | attributes of the player. Ok bot is an ok bot, random bot is random...  |

###What I learned making this app
- Javascript events
- Javascript DOM
- Javascript OOP basics
- Canvas basics
- How to build a simple Flask app

### Future plans
- make a better bot
- optimize some of the functions
- add online matchmaking
